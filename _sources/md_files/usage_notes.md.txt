# Starting the workflow

## The 'user settings.R' file - selection or creation

A 'user settings.R' file is required when using the 'convert to BIDS()' function.

```{note} 
The 'user settings.R' file stores the settings and variables you've chosen (folders, filename convention, dcm2niix string, regular expressions).
It is saved to the output directory and can be used again for future conversion processes.
A user dialogue will walk you through the creation and selection process.
```

## Do you have a `user settings` file?

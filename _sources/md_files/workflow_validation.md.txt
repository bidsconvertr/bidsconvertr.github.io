# BIDS validation

```{note} 
Only the metadata contained within the BIDS folder is free of potentially identifiable information. Follow the legal terms when sharing your dataset and consider additional defacing, pseudonymization, or both.
```

When everything is in order:

1.  The files are copied to BIDS.

2.  The BIDS validation process begins.
    If Docker is already installed on your machine, it is started automatically.
    If not, the online-version is launched, and you must choose your folder manually.
    Please note: Files are never uploaded to the BIDS-Validator.

3.  You are prompted, if you want to remove temporary images from your hard disk.
    Avoid performing this by hand!
    Only do this after validating your data and gathering all of your data.

# Install the BIDSconvertR

```{Note} 
Please install R in accordance with the instructions. From here, copy & paste the following commands into RStudio's 'console' panel.

Known issues:
- If you are asked to install the package from binary source files select "yes". 
- If you are asked to update packages, you can skip this step via '3' or update the packages via '1' or '2'.
- If there is a 'installation of package ‘devtools’ had non-zero exit status' error message, identify the package (here 'devtools') with the error message and install it manually via 'install.packages("package_name")'.
```



Both packages must be installed only once. 
The `devtools` package is required to install packages from Github.

``` r
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("devtools")
```



Using the command below, you can now install the most recent development version of `BIDSconvertR`.

``` r
devtools::install_github(repo = "wulms/bidsconvertr")
```

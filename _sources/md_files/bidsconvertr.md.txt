## Aim

[BIDSconvertR](https://github.com/wulms/bidsconvertr) aims to provide a workflow that can:

- do the task inside of the R environment
- convert DICOM data to NIfTI (with the awesome [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)
- structure this data according to the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Features

- continuous application
  - lazy processing of already existing files 
  - easy application during data collection in ongoing studies
- user-friendliness (minimial terminal interaction required)
  - user dialog with message boxes guiding the users through the workflow
  - Shiny App (GUI) for sequence editing and data inspection
- file cleaning 
  - Renaming of subject-IDs or session-IDs with regular expressions.
  - Renaming of session-IDs
- BIDS validation
  - verification (color-coded) of sequence-IDs (comparing the entered sequence-IDs to regular expressions according to BIDS)
  - implemented validation with [BIDS-Validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/) (Website/Docker)
- quality control 
  - user-friendly ([papayaWidget](https://github.com/muschellij2/papayaWidget) image viewer) for BIDS datasets
- pseudonymized BIDS output (only metadata)
  - all potentially identifiable metadata was removed from images and JSONs


```{note} 
Only the metadata contained within the BIDS folder is free of potentially identifiable information. Follow the legal terms when sharing your dataset and consider additional defacing, pseudonymization, or both.
```



## Milestones / To-Do's

- publish the BIDSconvertR
- testing the tool on MAC systems 
- create Docker container
- move image viewer into separate package
- adapt code to CRAN requirements

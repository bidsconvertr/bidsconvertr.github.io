```{Note} 
This part is optional. 
You should read this if your subject-IDs are messy (have a redundant prefix, suffix, or string, for example), or if you want to rename your session-IDs.

This section covers the optional cleaning or extraction of subject-ID’s and renaming
of sessions.

You are prompted to decide if you wish to edit subject- and session-ID’s during the user dialog.
You can skip this step if your data was already collected with clear subject- and session-ID’s:

| Yes                           | Set a subject-ID regular expression or set a string, prefix, suffix or regular expression, which is then removed from each subject-ID.  |

Each regex set here should match to your data. 
Contact me via email or the issues in this repository if you run across any troubles.

You should have enough freedom using these two routines to clean up your filenames and gradually change and improve your regular expression.
